                <h2 class="pageHeading">What is Private Limited Company Registration?</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">A private limited company is a company which is privately held for small businesses. The liability of the members of a Private Limited Company is limited to the amount of shares respectively held by them. Shares of Private Limited Company cannot be publically traded. All the aspects of Private Limited Company is discussed in this article.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">This is the most popular legal structure for businesses. It should be chosen by anyone looking to build a scalable business. As these entities must hold board meetings and file annual returns with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), they tend to be viewed with more credibility than a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP), One Person Company (OPC) or General Partnership. Start-ups and growing businesses choose to register a company in India because it allows outside funding to be raised easily, limits the liabilities of its shareholders and enables them to offer employee stock options to attract top talent.</p>
                <h2 class="pageHeading">Facts on Private Limited Company Registration</h2>
                <div class="essential">
                    <h4>What if I am a single founder?</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">A private limited company is an entity with minimum two directors and two shareholders. Single shareholders can also bring in their mother, father or any other relative to be part of the limited company with just one single share.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="essential">
                    <h4>Why do startups prefer private limited companies?</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">Startups set-up private limited companies so that they can raise venture capital funding and offer their best employees stock options. Without funding and stock options, it is almost impossible to build and scale a large business. Banks and other lenders would also much rather lend to private limited companies, as compared to sole proprietors.</p>

                <div class="essential">
                    <h4>What is the procedure to register one?</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">Initially, we help you get a digital signature certificate (also known as DSC), which is simply an e-signature to help you complete the registration online. You can get the DSC within two days from the time you submit the documents. Next, we apply for the Director Identification Number (also called a DIN). This typically takes one day. The third phase involves selection of your company name. Remember that your company name need not be your brand name. For example, Naukri.com has been incorporated as InfoEdge Technologies. Once done, we will prepare the Memorandum and Articles of Association and apply for the Certificate of Incorporation.</p>

                    <h4>How many shareholders can there be in a private limited company?</h4>

                <div class="essential">
                    <h4>How much do you need to invest?</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">You do not need to invest any money upfront. Private limited companies in India do not need to have any paid-up capital (that is, they do not need to introduce any money into the company).</p>
                </div>
                <div class="essential">
                    <h4>What regulatory requirements are placed on private limited company?</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">The regulatory requirements placed on private limited companies are fewer compared to those on public companies as private limited companies are not traded publicly.</p>
