                <h2 class="pageHeading">GST Return Filing</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">A return is a document containing details of income which a taxpayer is required to file with the tax administrative authorities. This is used by tax authorities to calculate tax liability. GST implementation is set to go-live in 2017, completely overhauling India's indirect tax system. Under the new GST regime, GST registration would be required for all enterprises involved in the buying or selling or delivery of services exceeding Rs.10 lakhs a year in north-eastern and hill states, while the limit is Rs.20 lakhs for rest of India. All entities having GST registration would be required to file GST returns. GST return filing would be mandatory for all GST registered entities irrespective of if there was any activity/sale during the return filing period.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">GST regime, any regular business has to file three monthly returns and one annual return. This amounts to 37 returns in a year. The beauty of the system is that one has to manually enter details of one monthly return – GSTR-1. The other two returns – GSTR 2 & 3 will get auto-populated by deriving information from GSTR-1 filed by you and your vendors. Compounding taxpayers would be required to file GSTR-4 every quarter, on 18th of the month next to the quarter. Finally, annual GST return must be filed by all GST registered entities on or before 31st of December.</p>

                <div class="essential">

                    <p class="text-justify">Subsumes various taxes like Purchase Tax, Central Sales Tax, Additional Customs Duty etc. Therefore, under GST, many of the taxes in existence today would be subsumed and made into one tax.

                <div class="essential">
                    <h4>Larger Tax Base</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">GST will use the latest in technology, including data from Aadhaar database, PAN database, etc., to make GST registration and GST return filing process, as smooth as possible. GST is expected to increase the tax base in India significantly. Therefore, the overall tax liability for businesses is expected to reduce overtime, as more and more businesses become compliant.</p>

                <div class="essential">
                    <h4>Lower Taxes</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">Currently in some states under the VAT regime, businesses are required to comply with VAT regulations once they cross an annual turnover of Rs.5 lakhs. Under GST regime, GST liability accrues only if an entity crosses an annual turnover of Rs.10 lakhs in northeast or hill states, whereas for rest of India, the threshold is set at Rs.20 lakhs.</p>

                <div class="essential">
                    <h4>Unified Platform</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">With the implementation of GST in India, the indirect taxes would be streamlined and standardized. Under GST regime, businesses would no longer have to obtain a separate VAT and Service Tax registration or  multiple VAT registrations in different States. A single GST registration would be sufficient for selling or purchasing goods or providing services.</p>

                <div class="essential">
                    <h4>Ease of Doing Business</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">Currently, many businesses like restaurants, computer sales and services businesses are adhere to both VAT and Service Tax regulations. This creates a compliance burden on the business, as they have to calculate taxes for the transaction based on different rates for different items. Under GST, the distinction between goods and services will be gone – making doing business easy.</p>
