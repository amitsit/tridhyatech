                <h2 class="pageHeading">What is GST Registration?</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">Goods and Services Tax or GST has been implemented in India from 1st July, 2017 and non-resident taxpayers are also required to obtain GST registration and file GST returns. According to the GST Act, Non-Resident foreign taxpayers (special cases under GST Registration) are those suppliers who have come for a short period to make supplies in India without having any business establishments here. To make local supplies products are normally imported . Therefore, they will be allowed to avail Input Tax Credit only on IGST paid on imports. However, other taxpayers can take credit for supplies made by them and filed in Form GSTR 5. All non-resident taxable persons are required to appoint an authorised person in India for the purpose of complying with GST regulations.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">The Goods and Services Tax Law has defined a ‘non-resident taxable person’ as any person who occasionally undertakes transactions involving the supply of goods or services, or both, whether as principal or agent or in any other capacity, but who has no fixed place of business or residence in India. In simple words, any or all the businesses which are supplying goods or services or data retrieval services from databases located outside India will fall under this definition and will come under the purview of the Goods and Services Tax law.</p>

                <div class="essential">
                    <h4>Unified Platform</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">The indirect taxes would be streamlined and standardized with the implementation of GST in India. Businesses would no longer have to obtain multiple VAT registration in different States or obtain a separate VAT and Service Tax registration  under GST regime. For selling or purchasing goods or providing services, a single GST registration would be sufficient for all over India .</p>
                </div>
                <div class="essential">
                    <h4>Subsuming of Taxes</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">Subsumes various other taxes like  Additional Customs Duty, Central Sales Tax, Purchase Tax, Luxury Tax, etc., Therefore, many of the taxes in existence today would be subsumed and made into one tax, under GST. This would make tax collection and compliance easy for businesses across the country.</p>

                <div class="essential">
                    <h4>Lower Taxes</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">Currently in some states, businesses are required to comply with VAT regulations once they cross an annual turnover of Rs.5 lakhs, under the VAT regime. GST liability accrues only if an entity crosses an annual turnover of Rs.10 lakhs in northeast or hill states under GST regime, whereas for rest of India, the threshold is set at Rs.20 lakhs.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="essential">
                    <h4>Ease of Doing Business</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">Currently, many businesses like restaurants, computer sales and services businesses have to comply with both VAT and Service Tax regulations. This creates a compliance burden on the business, as they have to calculate taxes for the transaction based on different rates for different items. The distinction between goods and services will be gone, under GST – making doing business easy.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="essential">
                    <h4>Larger Tax Base</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">GST is expected to increase the tax base significantly in India . Therefore, the overall tax liability for businesses is expected to reduce overtime, as more and more businesses become compliant. In other, GST will use the latest in technology, including data from Aadhaar database, PAN database, etc., to make GST registration and GST return filing process, as seamless as possible.</p>
