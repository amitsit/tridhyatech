                <h2 class="pageHeading">Adding a Director</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">As per section 260 and section 284 of the Companies Act, 1956, the Articles of Association of a company are the source of authority from where the Board of Directors draws the right to add new directors to the Board or remove existing ones. The Articles of Incorporation must provide for the addition of Directors. The person appointed must be eligible as per the relevant clauses in the Articles of Association and must give his consent to be a director in written form which the company must register with itself.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Directors are appointed by the shareholders of a Company for the management of a Company. A Private Limited Company is required to have a minimum of two Directors and a Limited Company is required to have a minimum of three Directors. On the other hand, a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) has Designated Partners and Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008 requires each LLP to have a minimum of two Designated Partners. Appointment or removal of a Director or Designated Partners is thus required due to various reasons. Shaligram Infotech can help you file the necessary filings to add or remove a Director from your Company or add or remove a Designated Partner from your LLP.</p>
