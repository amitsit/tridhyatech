                <p class="text-justify">
                    Profession Tax is a state-level tax that applies to salaried employees and professionals, including chartered accountants, lawyers and doctors. Professional Tax is deducted from the salary of the salaried employees by the employers and same is deposited with the State Government. The states which impose professional tax are Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Meghalaya, Odisha, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Tripura, and West Bengal.

                    Registration is mandatory within 30 days of employing staff in a business or, in the case of professionals, 30 days from the start of the practice. This tax needs to be deducted from the salary or wages paid. The amount varies by state and amount, but is capped at Rs. 2500 per annum.

                    <h4>In Every State</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">If you have employees in more than one state, you would need to get a Profession Tax Registration in each state. Even the rate at which it must be paid will vary. This makes it cumbersome for many small businesses to comply with. Do note, however, that many north Indian states do not levy Profession Tax at all.</p>

                <div class="essential">
                    <h4>Filing Returns</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">The frequency of return filing depends on the state you're in. For example, in Maharashtra, returns can be filed annually if the liability is under Rs. 5000, quarterly if the liability is under Rs. 20,000 and monthly if it is above Rs. 20,000. However, in West Bengal, returns need only be filed once every year. Nowadays, many states are moving towards this approach.</p>

                    <h4>Penalties Apply</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">A penalty of 10% of the amount owed can be imposed in Maharashtra in case of delayed payment of Profession Tax. A delay in obtaining the Enrollment Certificate will be charged at Rs. 2 per day.</p>
