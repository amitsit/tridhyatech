                <p class="text-justify">A TDS Return is a quarterly statement which has to be submitted to the Income Tax Department of India. Submitting TDS Return is mandatory if you are a deductor. It has details of TDS deducted and deposited by you. Tax Deduction Account Number or Tax Collection Account Number is a 10 -digit alpha-numeric number issued by the Income Tax Department. TAN is to be obtained by all persons who are responsible for deducting tax at source (TDS) or who are required to collect tax at source. Tax deducted at source (TDS) ensures that the Government's collection of tax is proponed and the responsibility for paying tax is diversified. The person deducting the tax at source is required to deposit the tax deducted to the credit of Central Government - quoting the TAN number. Individuals who are salaried are not required to obtain TAN or deduct tax at source. However, a proprietorship business and other entities (i.e., Private Limited Company, LLP, etc.) must deduct tax at source while making certain payment like salary, payments to contractor or sub-contractors, payment of rent exceeding Rs.1,80,000 per year, etc. Shaligram Infotech can help obtain TAN Registration.</p>
