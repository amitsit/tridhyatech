                <p class="text-justify">Starting from July 1, 2017, Goods & Services Tax (GST) will apply to all Indian service providers (including freelancers), traders and manufacturers, once their supply turnover crosses Rs. 20 lakh. GST is an indirect tax which is applicable on all supply of goods & services in India. GST shall be levied in place of existing sales tax, VAT, excise duty, customs, service tax, luxury tax etc. If you are supplying goods and services in India, then it is mandatory to take the GST registration. GST is to be charged at every step of the supply chain, with complete set of benefits available. The procedure for GST is completely online and requires no manual intervention. There will also be a composition scheme under GST for businesses with a supply turnover of less than Rs. 50 lakh.</p>
