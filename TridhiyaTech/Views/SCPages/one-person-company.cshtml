                <p class="text-justify">The One Person Company (OPC) was introduced as a strong improvement over the proprietorship. It gives a single promoter full control over the company while limiting his/her liability to contributions to the business. This person will be the only director and shareholder (there is a nominee director, but with no power until the original director is incapable of entering into contract). So there's no chance of raising equity funding or offering employee stock options.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">One Person Company, which is a new concept in India, already sees a big boom. A huge impact on the economy and development of nation is expected. It gives opportunities to many and will therefore bring creative and young minds in front of everyone. So, if you want to start up your own business, you don’t have to worry about all the complex and tedious processes.</p>

                            <p class="panel-body">An OPC is a good alternative to running a proprietorship, largely because it gives limited liability to the business owner. This means that your liability is limited to the amount you have invested in the business debts which cannot be recovered from personal possessions. Also, a sole proprietorship ceases to exist on the death of its promoter. In the case of an OPC, the nominee director takes over and the entity continues to exist. Single entrepreneur who do not have another partner to start a private limited company may also consider it.</p>
