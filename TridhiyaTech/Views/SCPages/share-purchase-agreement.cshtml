                <p class="text-justify">A Share purchase agreement (SPA) is an agreement setting out the terms and conditions relating to the sale and purchase of shares in a company.  The parties to a Share Purchase Agreement are the Purchaser and the Seller.  The aim of the document is to prove that the terms of the agreement were mutually agreed upon. Such an agreement specifies the consideration and the number of shares to be sold, the conditions precedent (the authorisations necessary, for example) and covenants by the parties. The shares will be allotted after this agreement is signed (and on the basis of this agreement). If a shareholder sells his shares in a company, then he achieves a complete break in the relationship between him and the target business. The buyer however, will insist upon some contractual promises about the company (warranties) which will continue to bind the shareholder after the sale.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify">SPA is an essential business practice when a shareholder is being inducted. While many new businesses take a casual approach to such matters, the absence of a document can have many undesirable consequences.</p>

                    <h4>Protects Parties</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">Such a document gives both parties the opportunity to protect their interests before the shares are transferred. Being a comprehensive document, it covers every aspect of the transaction and is crucial for both parties to examine each clause covered in the document and understand its meaning.</p>
