                <p class="text-justify">A Producer Company was introduced in India with the Companies Act, 2013. A Producer Company can be formed by 10 or more producers, two or more producer institutions or a combination of 10 or more producers and producer institutions. Such a company can only have equity capital, require a minimum of five directors and an authorised capital of Rs. 5 lakh. The procedure for forming a Producer Company is similar to the one for forming a Private Limited Company.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Producer Company means a corporate body having objects or activities as specified under the Act. It consists of a group of people involved in the production of primary produce or having one or more objectives relating to primary produce. In a Producer Company, you can appoint agriculturist members and accept deposits in the form of RD/FD and provide them maturity as well as distribute loans to your farmer members and charge interest from them.</p>
