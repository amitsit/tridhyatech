                <h2 class="pageHeading">What is LLP Registration?</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">LLP refers to Limited Liability Partnership and is governed by Limited Liability Partnership Act 2008. Limited Liability Partnership provides advantage of limited liability to its owners and at the same time requires minimal maintenance. The directors of a private limited company have limited liability to creditors. In case of default, banks/creditors can only sell company’s assets and not personal assets of directors.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">LLP is also cheaper to incorporate than a Private Limited Company, requires fewer compliances and can be a smart choice from a tax perspective. However, if you're looking to raise venture capital or attract talent with employee stock options, private limited is the way to go as LLPs cannot easily accommodate it. This is why they are most popular with professional services firms that require no equity funding.</p>

This is because many compliances, such as an audit, apply to LLPs only after their turnover is sizeable. Most LLPs spend about half as much as a Private Limited Company in their first year on registrations and compliance work.</p>

                <h2 class="pageHeading">Advantages of LLP</h2>
                <div class="essential">
                    <h4>Separate Legal Entity</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">An LLP is a legal entity and a juristic person established under the Act. The partners are distinct from the entity and both can sue each other and get sued in the process.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="essential">
                    <h4>Uninterrupted Existence</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">An LLP has ‘perpetual succession’, that is continued existence until it is brought on the terms of the dissolution by mutual agreement within the partners. Partners may come and go, but an LLP goes on.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="essential">
                    <h4>Audit not Required</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">Entrepreneurs earning a turnover of less than 40 Lakhs and capital contribution of less than 25 Lakhs need not get their accounts audited. Therefore, LLPs are ideal for startups and small businesses that are just starting their operations and want to have minimal regulatory compliance related formalities.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="essential">
                    <h4>Easy Transferability</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">The ownership of a LLP can be easily transferred to another person. All you need is to induct them as a Designated Partner of the LLP. LLP is a separate legal entity separated from its Managing Partners, so by changing the Managing Partners, the ownership of the LLP can be changed.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="essential">
                    <h4>Owning Property</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">An LLP being a juristic person, can acquire, own and enjoy property in its own name. And this is entirely distinct from its partners. No Partner can make any claim upon the property of the LLP so long as the LLP is a going concern.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="essential">
                    <h4>Limited Liability</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">The biggest advantage is Limited Liability, which means the status of being legally responsible only to a limited amount for debts of a LLP. Unlike proprietorships and partnerships, in a LLP the liability of the members in respect of the LLP’s debts is limited. The personal assets of the directors are safe if the company goes bankrupt.</p>
