                <p class="text-justify">A Section 8 Company is an organization which is registered as a Non-Profit Organization (NPO). NPO/company has its objective of promotion of arts, commerce, charity, education, protection of environment, science, social welfare, sports, research, religion and intends to apply its profits, if any, or other income in promoting its objects. It functions exactly like a limited company including all the rights and obligations that come with such a company. However, it differs from a company in one very crucial aspect, i.e. it cannot use the words “Section 8” or “Limited” in its name.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">A Section 8 Company is similar to a Trust or Society; expect, a Section 8 Company is registered under the Central Government's Ministry of Corporate Affairs. Trusts and Societies are registered under State Government regulations. A Section 8 company has various advantages when compared to Trust or Society like improved recognition and better legal standing. Section 8 company also has higher credibility amongst donors, Government departments and other stakeholders.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">The income of the Company must be used to promote only charitable objects and cannot pay any dividend to the members of the company. The central government provides an incorporation certificate to all such companies and also informs them about some restrictions and conditions. In case they don’t fulfil them, the central government may also order them to wind up the company. In case if any fraud objectives of the Company are proved, legal action will be taken against all officers of the Company.</p>

                    <h4>Name Approval &amp; License</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">Once DIN and DSC are available for atleast two Directors, application for reservation of name for Section 8 company can be made to MCA. Once, the name is reserved, a license must be obtained prior to incorporation.</p>
