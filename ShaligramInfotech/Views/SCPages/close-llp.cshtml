                <p class="text-justify">Shutting up a Limited Liability Partnership is a tedious, but necessary, procedure. Without doing so, you would need to annually meet the requirements of the Registrar of Companies (which means spending money on audit and compliances). However, if you are the owner of an incorporated business in the form of a Private Limited Company, then it is even more so. An LLP can be shut down in several manners depending upon the requirements of the business owner – Sell the company (if possible), Declare the company ‘defunct’ and shut it down or ‘Wind up’ and dissolve the company.</p>
