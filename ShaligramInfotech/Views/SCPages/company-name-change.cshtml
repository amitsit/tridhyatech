                <h2 class="pageHeading">Change in Company Name</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">Change in name of the Company involves alteration of Clause I of the Memorandum of Association of the Company. Section 13 of the Companies Act, 2013 regulates the process of alteration of Memorandum of Association of companies. Section 13 of the Companies Act, 2013 says that name of a company may be changed by passing a Special resolution in the general meeting and with the approval of the Central Government.</p>
                <h2 class="pageHeading">Steps for Changing Company Name</h2>
                <div class="essential">
                    <h4>Board Resolution</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">The board needs to authorise a change in the name of the Private Limited Company and authorise a director or company secretary to apply for the same to the MCA. At the same time, a decision needs to be taken to convene another board meeting for a change of name (after approval) and also to make changes in the Memorandum and Articles of Association (MoA and AoA).</p>
                </div>
                <div class="essential">
                    <h4>Check Availability</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">The application sent by the director or company secretary (or any authorised person) will be filed with the MCA. The procedure is similar to the application submitted during company incorporation and the new name should be in adherence to the naming guidelines given in the Companies Act, 2013.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="essential">
                    <h4>Special Resolution</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">If the name is approved, the company must hold an extraordinary general meeting to pass a special resolution for the change of company in the name and the same changes in the MoA and AoA.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="essential">
                    <h4>Approval of Company Name Change</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">Once the special resolution is passed, you will need to file this with the Registrar of Companies. A form 1B, along with the requisite fee for name change, as given by MCA, needs to be submitted to get the final approval. This is the crucial stage, and once you are through this, the next procedures are simple.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="essential">
                    <h4>New Certificate of Incorporation</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">If the Registrar is satisfied with the application, it will issue a new certificate of incorporation. This certificate is a clear indication that the name of the company has been changed, and all the documents and any communication will be effective with the use of the changed name, after they are incorporated in MoA and AoA.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="essential">
                    <h4>Alter the MoA and AoA</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">With the new certificate issued, you can now alter the MoA and AoA. This will finalise the procedure. Although a new incorporation certificate is issued (with the changed name), all the other legal formalities remain the same, and the company cannot get out of any past obligations to them.</p>
